Future's Edge is a youth-led organisation which we define as less than 26 years old. People who are 26 years old or more and interested in participating, they can apply to becone an advisor.


### 1. Defining Their Roles:

It's crucial to clearly define the roles of the advisors to ensure they complement, and not overshadow, the youth leadership. Here are some ways they could contribute:

* **Mentors/Advisors:** Provide guidance and support to the core team, offering advice, feedback, and access to their networks. They will NOT be making any decisions, and will act as advisors only.
* **Skill-Specific Coaches:** Share their expertise in specific areas, such as technology, marketing, finance, or governance. They may provide short, focused workshops or one-on-one coaching sessions.
* **Strategic Partners:** Help connect the movement with potential partners, funders, or advisors.
* **Resource Facilitators:** Identify and provide access to relevant resources such as software, equipment, or funding opportunities.
* **Trusted Guides:** Help navigate challenges and provide a grounding perspective based on their wider experience.
* **Safety Support:** Offer guidance and support in making sure the movement is safe for the youth, building accountability structures, and developing safety policies and procedures.

### 2. Ensuring a Youth-Led Environment:

It's essential to maintain the youth-led nature of your movement. Here's how to do that:

* **Advisory Capacity Only:** Emphasize that the professionals are in an advisory capacity and that the youth members are responsible for all decision-making.
* **Clear Boundaries:** Set clear boundaries for their involvement, ensuring they don't overstep their advisory roles.
* **Youth as Drivers:** Clearly state that while guidance and support are important, the project will be driven by young people.
* **Open Communication:** Foster open communication so that youth members feel comfortable providing feedback to the advisors and letting you know if any boundaries are being overstepped.
* **Limited Number of Advisors:** Consider a small number of advisors to avoid overwhelming the youth core team.
* **Rotation of Advisors:** To keep things fresh and ensure a wide range of perspectives, consider rotating through different advisors based on the projects or needs of the group.

### 3. Recruiting the Right Professionals:

Here are some factors to consider when choosing professionals:

* **Shared Values:** Look for individuals who align with your core values and are genuinely passionate about empowering youth.
* **Relevant Experience:** Select those who have experience in the areas where you need support.
* **Collaborative Mindset:** Choose those who are comfortable working in a mentoring/facilitation role and wonâ€™t take over control.
* **Willingness to Learn:** Ensure they are open to learning from the youth and understanding their perspectives.
* **Diversity:** Seek out professionals from diverse backgrounds and with diverse skill sets, to reflect your movement's focus on inclusion.
* **Passion:** Select those who are passionate about the idea of building a better world.

### 4. Initial Communication:

When reaching out to professionals, emphasize:

* **Their Advisory Role:** Clearly explain the specific ways you'd like them to contribute, including the mentoring or advisory structure.
* **The Youth-Led Nature:** Reassure them that their role is to guide and support, not to lead the decision-making process.
* **Their Impact:** Highlight the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of young people and support a global movement for change.
* **Their Connection to the Vision:** Ensure they understand the mission and vision and will support these, and not their own personal agendas.

### 5. Onboarding and Integration:

* **Introduction to Core Team:** Introduce the professional advisors to the youth core team, making clear their roles and responsibilities.
* **Regular Check-Ins:** Establish regular online check-in meetings between the advisors and the youth core team.
* **Feedback Mechanisms:** Develop a process for the youth members to provide feedback to advisors, and vice versa.
* **Open Communication:** Encourage an open dialogue that fosters mutual understanding and respect between youth members and advisors.
* **Training/Preparation:** Before they start as advisors, it may be good to provide them with a short training that explains the needs and values of the organisation.

### Benefits of Including advisors:

* **Expertise and Guidance:** Access to real-world experience and specialized knowledge.
* **Network and Connections:** Ability to reach potential partners, funders, and mentors.
* **Credibility and Validation:** Lending authority to the movement and its vision.
* **Strategic Direction:** Providing a broader perspective on the movement's goals and potential pathways.
* **Enhanced Learning Opportunities:** Providing access to professional development and training for your members.

### Incorporating this into Your Plan:

* **Target Specific Needs:** When you recruit professionals, think about areas where you need specific help (e.g., legal, finance, technology).
* **Start Small:** Start with a small number of advisors and expand as needed.
* **Let the Youth Lead:** Ensure that the youth members are always driving the movement.
* **Regularly Re-evaluate:** Assess how the mentors are contributing, to ensure the system is working well.

By carefully integrating the experience and expertise of advisors, while maintaining a clear youth-led focus, you will create a powerful and well-rounded movement that is poised for lasting success. This approach combines youthful energy with wisdom, experience, and strategic guidance.
