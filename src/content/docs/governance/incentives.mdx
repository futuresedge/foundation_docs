### Draft Incentives Framework for Futureâ€™s Edge (FE)

An effective incentives framework for Futureâ€™s Edge should encourage behaviors and activities that align with its **core mission**â€”empowering youth with digital skills, decentralized governance knowledge, and fostering global collaboration to solve societal challenges.

---

## 1. Desired Behaviors and High-Standard Activities
These are the key behaviors and activities that should be rewarded to further FE's mission:

### A. Knowledge & Skill Development
- Engaging in peer-to-peer learning and **mentoring others** in Web3, digital skills, governance, and social innovation.
- Completing **learning modules, hackathons, and certifications** in blockchain, AI, and ethical technology applications.
- Developing and **sharing open-source tools, research, or educational materials**.

### B. Leadership and Initiative
- **Launching and leading projects or squads** that focus on solving local or global challenges.
- Contributing to the **governance and improvement of FE's decentralized systems**.
- **Acting as a community connector**, bringing together members across different countries to collaborate on impactful projects.

### C. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
- Actively **engaging in discussions, debates, and forums** that push forward innovative ideas.
- Building bridges between **different cultural backgrounds**, promoting cross-border friendships and understanding.
- Documenting and sharing **best practices, lessons learned, and challenges** openly.

### D. Social Impact and Ethical Contributions
- Applying technology to **real-world problems** (e.g., sustainability, education, economic development).
- **Advocating for digital human rights, transparency, and ethical governance** in the tech space.
- Creating and participating in **pay-it-forward initiatives** that empower others.

### E. Governance Participation
- Proposing and voting on **community decisions through decentralized governance mechanisms**.
- **Reviewing and improving governance models** for fairness and transparency.
- Contributing to the development of **FEâ€™s open-source governance protocols**.

---

## 2. Discouraged Behaviors and Activities
To maintain the integrity and effectiveness of Futureâ€™s Edge, the framework should disincentivize the following:

### A. Behavior Contrary to FEâ€™s Values
- Hoarding knowledge instead of sharing it with the community.
- Gatekeeping or **excluding individuals from learning opportunities**.
- Exploiting FEâ€™s resources or reputation for **personal financial gain without giving back**.

### B. Governance and Reputation Misuse
- **Gaming the system** (e.g., inflating reputation scores artificially).
- Engaging in **fraudulent voting or manipulation of decentralized governance**.
- Violating **transparency principles**, such as making decisions in private that affect the community.

### C. Disruptive or Unethical Practices
- Engaging in harmful **competitive behavior that suppresses innovation**.
- Using FEâ€™s **technology or network for unethical, exploitative, or illegal activities**.
- **Harassing, discriminating, or spreading misinformation** within the community.

### D. Lack of Contribution
- Passive membership with **no participation in governance, learning, or collaboration**.
- Taking rewards without **contributing meaningfully to the mission**.

---

## 3. Incentive Mechanisms
The incentive structure should be **transparent, fair, and dynamically adjustable** based on community feedback.

### A. Reputation and Impact Score (On-Chain)
A **reputation score** powered by **smart contracts** will measure a memberâ€™s contributions based on:
1. Learning progress (e.g., course completions, certifications)
2. Contributions to projects and community initiatives
3. Mentorship and peer learning impact
4. Governance participation and proposal contributions
5. Ethical and trust-based behavior

**Reputation decay** could apply if a member disengages over time, ensuring active participation is continuously rewarded.

### B. Tokenized Incentives (Fungible & Non-Fungible)
- **Skill Tokens:** Earned by completing learning modules, attending workshops, or mentoring others.
- **Governance Tokens:** Earned by contributing to decision-making and governance processes.
- **Impact NFTs:** Unique badges and credentials that recognize members for outstanding contributions.

### C. Real-World and Digital Recognition
- **Access to exclusive mentorship opportunities, networking events, and learning programs**.
- **Funding support for impactful projects** through community-driven grants.
- **Recognition in FEâ€™s official channels** (newsletters, social media, events).
- **Invitations to leadership roles or advisory positions**.

### D. DAO-Driven Rewards & Resource Allocation
- The **FE DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** will govern resource allocation transparently.
- Members with **higher reputation scores** can unlock decision-making privileges and the ability to **propose and allocate funding** for new initiatives.

---

## 4. Additional Factors in Designing the Incentive Framework
### A. Community Feedback Loops
- Periodic reviews to **ensure fairness and prevent unintended exploitation**.
- **Open discussions on governance mechanisms** to allow iterative improvements.

### B. Sustainability & Scalability
- Avoid over-reliance on **monetary incentives** that might shift focus away from community-driven impact.
- **Ensure rewards align with long-term engagement and contributions**, rather than short-term activity.

### C. Localization & Accessibility
- Different incentive structures **for different regional needs and access to technology**.
- Alternative ways of contribution recognition beyond on-chain interactions (e.g., offline impact projects).

---

## Conclusion
This incentive framework is designed to be **scalable, transparent, and values-driven** while ensuring Futureâ€™s Edge remains a **youth-led, globally connected, and innovation-driven movement**. By leveraging **reputation systems, smart contracts, and community-driven governance**, the framework will inspire and sustain **meaningful engagement, learning, and impact**.
