Future’s Edge is a global youth-led movement designed to empower young people with essential digital economy skills, self-directed learning, and decentralized governance knowledge. Members engage in missions, governance activities, and self-development while building a meaningful portfolio of accomplishments. The movement fosters collaboration, innovation, and impact through a structured yet flexible framework that values trust, merit, and community-driven learning.

## Onboarding Experience
### Pathway to Membership:
1. **Interest Registration**: Prospective recruits (PRs) express interest on the Future’s Edge website.
2. **Welcome Meeting**: PRs attend a session with an existing Future’s Edge Field Office (FO).
3. **Community Integration**: PRs are welcomed and introduced to their FO.
4. **Application & Acceptance**: PRs apply for membership and become probationary members (Recruits).
5. **Onboarding Missions**: Recruits undertake self-paced and collaborative tasks to gain initial trust points.
6. **Trust Ceremony**: Upon successful completion of onboarding, recruits are officially initiated as Novice Members (NMs).

## Member Experience Overview
Members engage in activities across four core areas, earning incentives such as **trust score points**, **skill proofs (badges)**, and **impact recognitions**.

Initial mind dump and GPT response

My ideas for the onboarding experience include this best case scenario pathway:

1. The Prospective recruit (PR) registers interest in joining on the public FE website
2. They are invited to attend their first meeting by a welcome party team member
3. They attend a meeting and experience a regular weekly session with an existing Future's Edge field office (FO)
4. They are welcomed and introduced to the FO, the prospective recruit introduces themselves
5. The PR is invited to become a member by completing an application
6. The PR is accepted as a "recruit" (probationary member) and joins their field office, receives their welcome kit and access to the FE member platform
7. The recruit sets up their member profile, completes self-assessment tools, achieves their first milestones and incentives
8. Their field office "buddy" has a call with the recruit 
9. The recruit attends field office meetings and undertakes the onboarding mission (project) which includes some solo tasks, some collaborative tasks (with other recruits and sometimes with junior and senior members)
10. When the recruit has completed onboarding missions and reached the required "trust score" to gain member status, they are invited to begin the initiation journey
11. The recruit is given a welcome "trust ceremony" where they are recognised as a novice member (NM)

Member experience activities are grouped into several categories

1. Field office activities
2. Governance 
3. Self-development
4. Missions

All activities are optional but incentivised. Members who complete these activities receive "trust score" points as recognition of the value they are adding to the organisation. 

Some activities may offer other forms of incentives such as skill badge points, impact score points, leadership score points, gratitude score points etc.

## Field office activities
- Attend weekly briefings (online meetings), which are also recorded, transcribed for those who don't attend
- Participate in field office governance tasks and other activities within the briefing
- Share self-development and mission updates during the check-in
- Complete field office missions outside briefings

A member will take on a range of governance and operational roles within their field office over time. 

A briefing will have a standard agenda that can be modified as needed to accommodate a variety of situations eg. new member ceremonies, proof (skill badge) awarding ceremonies, mission debriefs (presentations of completed missions), guest speakers etc

The field office serves as an ongoing peer group that includes members from different geographies, ages, interests and abilities. 

Field offices strive to maintain a balance of personal strengths within their membership to give it the best chance of sustainable and successful achievement of its goals

Field offices exist within the structure of the wider organisation and are in competition with other offices in a number of KPIs (governance participation, impact, value production etc)

## Governance
Every member is incentivised to participate and be engaged with the governance of the organisation.

The governance happens at several levels. 
1. Field office
2. Division
3. Organisation

A member's trust score is the key indicator of their overall value to the organisation and represents their trustworthiness.

A member's ability to hold certain roles or be promoted to higher ranks will depend on specified trust score thresholds, among other factors, and is part of the overall incentive structure of the organisation.

The idea is that members should be incentivised to make the best decisions for the community as a whole, rather than act in self-interest. This would include disincentives for maliciously taking actions that cause harm others or the organisation such as a loss of trust points and perhaps rank.

As a youth-led organisation, 25+ year old members will not hold official governance positions or have voting power, but can participate in the design, development and discussion of proposals in an advisory capacity - this advisory should be presented as non-loaded questions that prompt further consideration

Governance activities will mostly be the design, development and discussion of proposals, and the casting of votes.

The proposal activities may include participating in "councils" or "think tanks" formed by governance decree. A council will be formed for each of the organisations values, mission success criteria and strategic pillars and be a guiding force in ongoing improvement. Members can be elected to a seat on a council and it is a privileged honour that demonstrates the member's immense value contribution to the organisation and the community at large. Positions have term limits however an emeritus or honorary position may be granted to outstanding contributors after their term has ended.

## Self Development

These activities include:
1. self-directed learning, 
2. self-awareness exercises and assessments, 
3. knowledge sharing (design, production of learning media, unearthing of research) 
4. journaling, 
5. community service, 
6. life design, purpose finding
7. strategic pathway development
8. personal profile/brand building

All these activities are incentivised because they:
1. add value to the organisation and the community at large - knowledge asset
2. increases the power and value of the member
3. progresses the organization towards its goals and mission

Members' profile pages are an immutable record of their completed missions, skill proofs, trust scores and other awards, and serves as a portfolio of their work

## Missions

- Members can earn proofs (skill badges) by completing missions. 
- There are a wide range of standard missions available and members can choose the missions that meet their self-development goals.
- There are solo missions and collaborative/team missions.
- Some missions are simple and able to be done in a short amount of time through to highly complex, long term missions.
- There are foundational missions which should be completed by all members and provide a broad skill base and build confidence in emerging technology, social impact and leadership.
- Members can then choose specialisations that align with their goals and ambitions
- Some missions are only available to members once they have reached certain skill levels and trust scores
- Every mission outlines the evidence a member must submit to prove they have fulfilled the requirements
- Missions are a combination of P2P learning, project-based learning and incentivised learning
	- Mission accomplishment is judged by peers in a decentralized way


### Example missions
Here's a sample of missions for different categories but there will many more available for members to choose from in each category.

#### Standard missions
These missions don't require any specific skillset and are focused on the sustainable growth and success of the organisation through advancing its values 

1. Share knowledge by creating media and adding to the KnowledgeBank
2. Onboard a new recruit
3. Perform an operational role in the organisation
4. Be elected to a governance position
5. Build awareness of FE through public relations activities
6. Participate in mentoring

#### Impact missions
These are designed to create value for local and global communities and build a range of skills.

1. Digital transformation projects for local businesses or community organisations/not-for-profits
2. Volunteering with social enterprises and charities
3. Providing technology access and digital skills training for kids or elders in underserved communities


#### Growth missions
These missions require a member to complete a number of tasks that add value to the organisation, the wider community, and progress the member along their learning journey and achieve their skill proof goals.

Growth missions will fall into one of these categories (this a non-exhaustive list) 

1. Converging, emerging tech - leverage 2 or more emerging technologies to solve a problem faced by a chosen industry or field
2. R&D - research, design and develop new methods, frameworks or models that accelerate the achievement of organisational and personal goals
3. DAO governance experimentation - take a scientific approach to explore governance challenges within the context of a decentralized organisation and smart contracts 
4. Advocacy - design, develop and deliver programs that advance the causes of the organisation 
5. Visionary art - create art of any form that helps the community envision a better future and promotes the values of FE
