Future's Edge is a global, youth-led movement designed to empower young people with **next-generation digital skills** and **knowledge of decentralized governance**, equipping them to tackle global challenges through local, technology-driven solutions. 

By integrating blockchain, Web3, and emerging technologies into a gamified, community-driven learning experience, the movement addresses the gap in education systems' ability to prepare youth for the fast-changing, high-tech world. 

It solves problems like the lack of digital literacy, leadership opportunities, and equitable access to cutting-edge technologies, especially in underserved communities.
