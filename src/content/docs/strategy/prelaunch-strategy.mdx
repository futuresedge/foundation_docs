Fantastic, Pete! Recognizing that your founding members have diverse interests and limited time is crucial. Giving them agency to choose subprojects and integrating their unique strengths right from the beginning will create a more engaged and empowered team. Acknowledging that this will be a "side project" and balancing progress with well-being is also a smart move.

Here’s how we can integrate these ideas into your approach:

**1. Self-Selection of Subprojects:**

*   **Subproject Categories:** Clearly define the main areas of work for the initial phase. Examples could include:
    *   **Platform Development:** Focused on building the digital infrastructure using Astro JS and Starlight.
    *   **Smart Contract Design:** Working on the technical architecture for the reputation score system.
    *   **Content Creation:** Designing the learning modules and documentation.
    *   **Community Engagement:** Planning social media outreach and community building activities.
    *   **Governance Framework:** Defining the decentralized decision-making process for the movement.
*   **Transparent Project Descriptions:** For each subproject, provide a detailed description of the tasks involved, the skills required, and the estimated time commitment.
*   **Application Form:** In your application form, allow applicants to nominate their top 2-3 subprojects that align with their skills and interests.
*   **Flexible Teams:** Create small, flexible teams around each subproject, allowing individuals to participate in multiple projects as their skills and interest evolve.
*   **Decentralized Team Management:** Empower the teams to self-manage, with you providing guidance and resources as needed.
*   **Open Communication Channels:** Establish dedicated communication channels for each subproject so teams can easily collaborate, share progress, and ask questions.

**2. Integrating Unique Strengths:**

*   **Strengths Assessment:**
    *   Provide a reputable online strengths assessment tool that your founding members can access (e.g. Gallup CliftonStrengths, or another of your choice).
    *   Ensure the assessment is accessible, user-friendly, and easy to understand.
    *   Reimburse or pay for each member to complete the assessment – making a clear statement about their value to the project.
    *   Perhaps provide a short training or summary that helps them understand their results.
*   **Strengths in Application:** In your application form, ask members to:
    *   Share their key strengths as indicated by their self-assessment results.
    *   Explain how they believe their unique strengths will contribute to the movement.
*   **Project Assignment:** When forming teams, use the information on strengths to strategically pair people with diverse but complementary talents, and consider this when making your final decisions.
*   **Focus on Contribution:** Ensure that all members understand that everyone's contribution is valuable, no matter their skills or their areas of interest.

**3. Balancing Progress and Well-Being:**

*   **Time Commitment Expectations:** Be clear that this is a side project, and that you understand everyone has other commitments.
*   **Flexible Schedules:** Allow members to work on their own schedules and at their own pace.
*   **Weekly Check-ins:** Hold regular, short check-in meetings to review progress, offer support, and address any roadblocks.
*   **Prioritize Quality Over Speed:** Emphasize the quality of the output over speed, creating a supportive and relaxed environment where people can do their best work.
*   **Avoid Over-Scheduling:** Be careful not to overwhelm team members with excessive meetings or task lists. Allow for flexibility and experimentation.
*   **Encourage Breaks:** Encourage members to take breaks, relax, and prioritize their own well-being.
*   **Celebrate Success:** Regularly celebrate small wins and progress to keep members motivated.

**4. First Meeting: Vision, Engagement, and Q&A:**

*   **Clear Presentation of Vision:** Start the meeting with an engaging presentation that clearly outlines your vision, the core values, and the mission of the movement, emphasizing your excitement for working with these young people.
*   **Subproject Overview:** Introduce the subproject categories and explain the tasks involved in each one.
*   **Open Discussion:** Allow ample time for questions and answers, encouraging members to share their thoughts and ideas.
*   **Solicit Feedback:** Ask the attendees for any initial ideas they have about the movement, its structure, and the platform we will build.
*   **Set Expectations:** Clearly outline your expectations for participation, time commitment, and the level of involvement you need from the core team.
*   **Actionable Next Steps:** After the meeting, send out the application form and clearly state a deadline for submissions.

**5. Application Form:**

*   **Personal Details:** Ask for basic contact information and locations.
*   **Motivation and Values:** Inquire about why they're interested in joining, and how their own personal values align with the suggested core values of the movement.
*   **Strengths and Skills:** Include a section for members to share their top strengths from their assessment, their technical skills, and areas of expertise.
*   **Subproject Preferences:** Allow members to select their top 2-3 preferred subproject areas.
*   **Availability:** Get an understanding of their time availability and current commitments.
*   **Commitment to Core Values:** Ask them to confirm their commitment to the core values of the movement (as they will be refined by the founding team).
*   **Any other ideas?** Provide an option to offer additional thoughts and ideas they have on the overall project.

**Integration with Your Values:**

*   **Unique Strengths:** By allowing members to choose subprojects aligned with their strengths, you are practicing the core value of "Uniqueness."
*   **Lifelong Learning:** You’re providing opportunities for learning new skills and expanding expertise in a hands-on, practical way.
*   **Purpose:** You are empowering members to find meaning and purpose by working on meaningful projects aligned with the mission of the movement.
*   **Reciprocal Altruism:** You are building a system where members can share their knowledge and help others in the process.
*   **Trust:** Your transparency and genuine commitment to collaboration fosters an environment of trust.
*   **Openness:** You are building using open source tools and actively encouraging feedback from all members.
*   **Design Thinking:** You are engaging your members in a user-centred development process where the platform will be designed for their needs.

By taking this approach you can create an engaging and empowering onboarding process that will set the stage for a collaborative and impactful journey. You will also be ensuring you have a good alignment of people with skills and projects.
